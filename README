Provides the following features:
 - Process the slogging data and populate a database of the usage data. (slogging_processor)
 - Provides an API endpoint for the usage data. (swift_usage_service)

slogging needs to be correctly configured and running in order for this code to be useful at all.


slogging_processor
------------------
This should be run as a cron to populate the database with the usage data from slogging as it is created.

Requires a connection to your swift machine with a user and key to be configured in '/etc/swift/swift-usage.conf'

[slogging-processor]
swift-auth-url = http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1.0
swift-user = <your user>
swift-key = <your key>
(Check the swift-usage.conf.sample file for additional config options.)


swift_usage_service
-------------------
This should be run at boot in order to expose the API to access the usage data.

This service uses PasteServer and Bottle to expose the usage data via a REST API.  

Check the swift-usage.conf.sample file for configuration options.


additional details
------------------
'admin/create_admin.py' creates an admin user for the api (this user can generate new api keys and needs to be setup first).
'admin/generate_key.py' is an example of how an admin would create new api keys via the API.

'examples/get_usage.py' shows an example of how the usage api is used.

'swift-usage.conf.sample' is an example of the config file to be placed in '/etc/swift/swift-usage.conf'
